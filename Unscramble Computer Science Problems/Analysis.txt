Task 0: 
Run time analysis of worst case Big o is O(n)

	Looking for an specific index takes constant time in other word O(1)
	Import of both lists takes O(n) for each list 

Task 1:
Run time analysis of worst case Big o is O(n)

	Import of both lists takes O(n) for each list 
	Looping through both lists takes O(n) for each

Task 2:
Run time analysis of worst case Big o is O(n)

	Import of both lists takes O(n) for each list
	Building the dictionary takes O(n)
	Iterating through the dictionary takes O(n)

Task 3:
Run time analysis of worst case Big o is O(nlog_n)

	Import of both lists takes O(n) for each list
	Looping through both list and set takes O(n) for each
	in code sort takes O(nlog_n)
	
Task 4:
Run time analysis of worst case Big o is O(nlogn)

	Import of both lists takes O(n) for each list
	Looping through 4 sets takes O(n) for each
	in code sort takes O(nlog_2n)
